\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

As illustrated in the previous sections, DeepProbLog is a powerful framework where general-purpose neural
networks and expressive probabilistic-logical modeling and reasoning are integrated in a way that exploits the full expressiveness and strengths of both worlds. For these reasons, the framework is suitable for solving problems where both low-level data processing using deep networks and high-level reasoning using symbolic approaches are needed.

After an explanation of DeepProbLog, we have illustrated how to create and train a DeepProbLog program to solve the multi-digit MNIST octal-division task. Our experiments showed that DeepProbLog was able to accurately recognize the MNIST digits and perform the division operation accurately, even when presented with multi-digit numbers.
% Overall, we demonstrated the effectiveness of DeepProbLog in solving machine learning tasks that require both low-level perception and high-level reasoning.

Compared to standard neural classifiers, DeepProbLog requires fewer iterations to converge, due to the fact that exploits symbolic reasoning, and provides a transparent and interpretable framework, which is particularly important in applications where decisions have significant consequences.

% Moreover, we found that DeepProbLog required fewer iterations to converge compared to standard neural classifiers, which is likely due to the fact that DeepProbLog combines the efficiency of deep learning with the expressiveness of probabilistic programming.

% The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepProbLog in solving AI tasks that require both low-level perception and high-level reasoning.
% Similarly, many more AI tasks that require both low-level perception and high-level reasoning can be efficiently solved using the DeepProbLog language.
% DeepProbLog neural probabilistic logic programming language.

% TODO: standard neural classifier requires more iterations to converge, multi-digit numbers in the test set, larger test set.

% Overall, our results demonstrate that DeepProbLog is a powerful framework for solving complex probabilistic modeling tasks and has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.

% Overall, our results highlight the potential of DeepProbLog in integrating probabilistic reasoning with deep learning techniques and in advancing the state-of-the-art in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. Future work could explore the application of DeepProbLog to other complex modeling tasks and the development of more efficient optimization techniques.
